# Wizarding World Profile

In this project, you will build out a profile for your favorite Wizarding World character. You will do this by creating variables or constants (whichever is most appropriate) of their personal details. 

To find details for your favorite Wizarding World characters, I recommend you use https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki and then type the character name in the search bar at the top. If you cannot find some of the details, that is okay.

### Part One - Basic Character Details

For the following, think about what Type should be used and whether a variable or a constant would be best.

* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters first name.
* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters last name.
* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters birth year.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters nationality.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters blood-status.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters gender.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters height. Be precise (this might require a little math).
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters weight.

### Part Two - Character Status - “It’s Complicated…”

For the second part of this project, we are going to capture some values that are a little more complicated. The answers to the following questions may change depending on where you are looking in a characters story arch. So, if controversial, feel free to use your opinion when answering. And of course, be prepared to defend your decisions :)

* create a variable or constant to represent whether or not your character appeared in the Harry Potter Movies. Think about how you name this.
* create a variable or constant to represent whether or not your character appeared in the prequel series, Fantastic Beasts. Think about how to name this.
* create a variable or a constant to represent whether or not your character was Dumbledores Army.
* create a variable or a constant to represent whether or not your character was a Death Eater.

### Part Three - Your Opinion

For the final part of this project, you are going to share your opinion of this character as well as how well they were portrayed, and why this character is your favorite.

* create a variable or constant to represent how important your character was to the Harry Potter franchise. An example of your value could be “crucial” or “unimportant”.
* create a variable or a constant showing your overall rating (out of 10) of the performance by your characters actor/actress. If your character was not portrayed by an actor or actress give them a zero.
* create a variable or constant which holds a value of a brief reason why this character is your favorite character.
